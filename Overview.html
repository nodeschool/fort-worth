				<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
				<p>
					<h4>Here at Node FTW, we want everyone to have a great time learning. The below guildeines will be enforced during each meetup.</h4>
					<br /> <br/> We, the organizers of NodeSchool Fort Worth, are dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for
					everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age,
					body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.
					Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the organizers
					of NodeSchool Fort Worth.
					<br/><br/> Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual
					orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate intimidation,
					threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate
					physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any events at NodeSchool
					Fort Worth meetups or in any related communication channels. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior
					are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors and presenters are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.
					<br/><br/> If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the organizers of NodeSchool Fort Worth may take any
					action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community. If you are being harassed,
					notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns, please contact an organizer immediately.
